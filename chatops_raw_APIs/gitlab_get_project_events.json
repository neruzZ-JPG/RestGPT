It offers various filtering options like by action type, target type, and date range. You can sort the events in ascending or descending order. Note that some features like certain epic details and some types of notes on merge requests are not available. Dates for before and after parameters should be in YYYY-MM-DD format, and events older than 3 years are removed for performance reasons."
