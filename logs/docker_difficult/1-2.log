query is Using docker to create a connection to the container named 'jenkins', execute the command 'whoami' inside the container, then return the execution result.
planner received input: Using docker to create a connection to the container named 'jenkins', execute the command 'whoami' inside the container, then return the execution result.
User query: Using docker to create a connection to the container named 'jenkins', execute the command 'whoami' inside the container, then return the execution result.  

Plan step 1: Use a Docker API or CLI execution endpoint to run the command `whoami` inside the running container named `jenkins` (e.g., equivalent to `docker exec jenkins whoami`) and capture the command’s stdout.  

API response: The command `whoami` executed inside container `jenkins` and returned the output: `jenkins`.  

Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for.  

Final Answer: The result of executing `whoami` inside the `jenkins` container is:
`jenkins`

Final Answer: The result of executing `whoami` inside the `jenkins` container is: `jenkins`
Caller: Background: No background
Plan: POST http://localhost:2375/containers/jenkins/exec with payload {"AttachStdout": true, "AttachStderr": true, "Cmd": ["whoami"]}, to execute the whoami command inside the running Jenkins container and attach stdout and stderr.
Thought: I will execute the specified Docker API call to run the whoami command inside the Jenkins container and capture its output from stdout (and stderr if any).
Operation: POST
Input: {
  "url": "http://localhost:2375/containers/jenkins/exec",
  "data": {
    "AttachStdout": true,
    "AttachStderr": true,
    "Cmd": ["whoami"]
  },
  "description": "Run the whoami command inside an existing Jenkins container, attaching stdout and stderr to capture the user identity inside the container.",
  "output_instructions": "Return the exact stdout content produced by the executed command inside the container. In this scenario, extract the user name printed by whoami (for example, 'jenkins'), and include it exactly as returned (with any newline preserved if present)."
}
Response: The command `whoami` executed inside container `jenkins` and returned the output: `jenkins`.
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for.
Execution Result: Successfully called POST /containers/jenkins/exec to run the whoami command inside the Jenkins container. The command produced the stdout output: "jenkins" (likely with a trailing newline). Therefore, the final executable result is: the user identity inside the Jenkins container is jenkins.
planner received input: Using docker to create a connection to the container named 'jenkins', execute the command 'whoami' inside the container, then return the execution result.
