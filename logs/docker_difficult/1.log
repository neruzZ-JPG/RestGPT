GET http://localhost:2375/containers/json?all=true
Caller: Background: No background
Plan: Use the Docker API to locate the container with the exact name "jenkins" and retrieve its container ID by calling GET http://localhost:2375/containers/json?all=true.
Thought: I will request a list of all containers (including stopped ones) and then search through the Names field of each container for an exact match to "/jenkins" (Docker container names in the API typically appear with a leading slash). If a match is found, I will extract the Id field as the container ID and report it. If no match is found, I will report that no matching container exists and provide any nearby context from the response to aid debugging.

  "description": "The API response is a list of all containers (including stopped ones). We need to locate the container whose name exactly matches 'jenkins' in the Names array (each Names item starts with a '/'). We will identify the container's ID (the 'Id' field) for use in subsequent steps.",
  "output_instructions": "From the API response, find a container whose Names array contains '/jenkins' or exactly 'jenkins' after trimming the leading '/'. If such a container is found, extract its container ID (the 'Id' field) and return it. If not found, report that no matching container was found and include any relevant names from the response to aid debugging."
