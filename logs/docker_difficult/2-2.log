API Selector: Background: No background
User query: Plan step 1: Create a Docker network named `test-network` using the appropriate Docker API or CLI equivalent.

POST http://localhost:2375/networks/create
Body:
{
  "Name": "test-network"
}

API response:
Caller: Background: No background
Plan: Plan step 1: Create a Docker network named `test-network` using the POST http://localhost:2375/networks/create with body {"Name": "test-network"}.
Thought: I will perform a POST request to the Docker API to create a new network with the given name. I expect the response to include the network's unique Id which can be used for subsequent API calls. I will prepare the input data accordingly and expect a JSON response containing the Id field (and possibly Warnings).
Operation: POST
Input: {
  "url": "http://localhost:2375/networks/create",
  "data": {
    "Name": "test-network"
  },
  "description": "Create a Docker network named test-network. The API response will contain the Id of the newly created network.",
  "output_instructions": "From the API response, extract the Id field which is the unique identifier of the created network. Provide the id value in a natural-language statement and note that the network name is test-network. This id will be used for any subsequent API calls that require the network id. If the response includes a Warnings field, mention if any warnings exist."
}
Response: {
  "Id": "d1f2e3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0",
  "Warnings": ""
}
Thought: I am finished executing the plan. The network has been created successfully and I obtained the network Id for future use.
Execution Result: Successfully called POST /networks/create to create a Docker network named test-network. The API response indicates the network has been created with Id d1f2e3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0. The network name requested was test-network, and the returned Id uniquely identifies the created network for future operations. No warnings were reported in the response. The resulting network Id (d1f2e3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0) should be kept for any subsequent API calls that require the network identifier.
