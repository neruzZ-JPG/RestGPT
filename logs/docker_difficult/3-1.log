POST http://localhost:2375/volumes/create
Body:
{
  "Name": "test-volume",
  "Driver": "local"
}
Caller: Background: No background
Plan: Plan step 1: Create a Docker volume named `test-volume` using the Docker volumes create API, specifying the name `test-volume`.
Thought: I will perform a POST request to the Docker volumes create API at http://localhost:2375/volumes/create with the body containing the volume name and driver as specified.
Operation: POST
Input: {
  "url": "http://localhost:2375/volumes/create",
  "data": {
    "Name": "test-volume",
    "Driver": "local"
  },
  "description": "Create a Docker named volume called test-volume using the local driver. The response will indicate the created volume's name, driver, and mount point.",
  "output_instructions": "From the API response, extract the Name of the created volume (which should be 'test-volume'), the Driver used (likely 'local'), and the Mountpoint path on the host where the volume data is stored. If Mountpoint is provided, include it; otherwise note its absence. Present the final results clearly."
}
Response: {
  "Name": "test-volume",
  "Driver": "local",
  "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/test-volume/_data"
}
Thought: I am finished executing the plan
Execution Result: Successfully called POST http://localhost:2375/volumes/create to create a Docker volume named "test-volume" using the local driver. The API response confirms the volume creation with Name: "test-volume", Driver: "local", and Mountpoint: "/var/lib/docker/volumes/test-volume/_data". This indicates the volume has been created and is mounted at the specified host path, ready for use.
