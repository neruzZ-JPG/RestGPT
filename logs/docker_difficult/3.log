planner received input: First, create a Docker volume named 'test-volume'. Then, query its information. Finally, delete it.Return the queried volume details.
Plan step 1: Create a Docker volume named `test-volume` using the Docker volumes API or CLI equivalent (e.g., `docker volume create --name test-volume`).

API response: The volume `test-volume` has been created successfully, with its associated ID and default options.

Plan step 2: Query detailed information for the Docker volume named `test-volume` using the Docker volumes inspect API or CLI equivalent (e.g., `docker volume inspect test-volume`), retrieving its name, driver, mountpoint, labels, scope, and any other metadata.

API response: The Docker volume `test-volume` has the following details:
- Name: test-volume
- Driver: local
- Mountpoint: /var/lib/docker/volumes/test-volume/_data
- Labels: {}
- Scope: local
- Options: {}

Plan step 3: Delete the Docker volume named `test-volume` using the Docker volumes delete API or CLI equivalent (e.g., `docker volume rm test-volume`), ensuring that `test-volume` is removed after the information has been retrieved.

API response: The volume `test-volume` has been deleted successfully and no longer exists on the Docker host.

Thought: I have created the Docker volume `test-volume`, queried its information, then deleted it. The user only wants the queried volume details as the final answer.

Final Answer: Here are the details of the Docker volume `test-volume` that were queried before deletion:

- Name: test-volume  
- Driver: local  
- Mountpoint: /var/lib/docker/volumes/test-volume/_data  
- Labels: {}  
- Scope: local  
- Options: {}
