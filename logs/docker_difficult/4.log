{"status":"Status: Downloaded newer image for busybox:latest"}

Parser: Interpretation

- The pull operation started and completed successfully.
  - Status progression shows pulling from library/busybox, pulling fs layers, downloading, extracting, and a final “Pull complete”.
  - The line “Status: Downloaded newer image for busybox:latest” confirms the image was pulled (or updated) to the busybox:latest tag.
  - A digest is provided: Digest: sha256:d80cd694d3e9467884fcb94b8ca1e20437d8a501096cdf367a5a1918a34fc2fd. This is the content digest of the pulled image.
- Image ID
  - The streaming JSON does not include an explicit image ID (the IDs seen in the stream are layer IDs and the tag reference, not the final image’s Id). Therefore, no final image ID is present in this response.
- Repository:Tag
  - busybox:latest

What you can do next (to obtain the image ID and size)

- Query local images to find the pulled image by repository and tag:
  - GET http://localhost:2375/images/json?filters={"reference":["busybox:latest"]}
  - Or GET http://localhost:2375/images/json and filter results client-side for RepoTags containing "busybox:latest".
- If the image exists, the response will include an object with:
  - Id: the image ID (e.g., sha256:abcdef... or a shorter form depending on API version)
  - RepoTags: ["busybox:latest"]
  - Size and VirtualSize: numeric values representing the image size

What you’ll see in the image info (example fields you might get)
- Id: <image-id>
- RepoTags: ["busybox:latest"]
- Size: <image-size-in-bytes>
- VirtualSize: <virtual size-in-bytes>

Summary of the provided response
- Pull started: Yes
- Pull progress: Completed (pull complete) with final status indicating the image is available as busybox:latest
- Final image ID: Not provided in this response
- Digest of pulled image: sha256:d80cd694d3e9467884fcb94b8ca1e20437d8a501096cdf367a5a1918a34fc2fd
- Repository:Tag: busybox:latest

If you want me to, I can draft the exact curl command to run to fetch the image ID from your environment.

Parser: Summary of the API response interpretation

- Did the pull operation start successfully?
  Yes. The first line indicates pulling from library/busybox with the tag latest, followed by a digest line and a final status stating the image is up to date for busybox:latest. This shows the pull process was initiated and completed, and the local image is current.

- Streaming progress and completion:
  - Pulling from library/busybox
  - Digest: sha256:d80cd694d3e9467884fcb94b8ca1e20437d8a501096cdf367a5a1918a34fc2fd
  - Status: Image is up to date for busybox:latest

- Image ID:
  - No explicit image ID (a numeric or short ID) is provided in the response.
  - The response provides a digest (sha256:d80cd694d3e9467884fcb94b8ca1e20437d8a501096cdf367a5a1918a34fc2fd) which identifies the content of the pulled image.
  - The "id" shown is "latest," which is the tag, not the image ID.

- Repository:tag
  - busybox:latest

- Size
  - Not provided in the response.

- How to verify the image exists (recommended steps):
  - Call GET /images/json and filter for Repository "busybox" and Tag "latest".
  - You should see an image entry with RepoTags including busybox:latest and an Id (the actual image ID) plus Size if available.

Final image id (if found): Not provided in the response. Use the verification step above to retrieve the actual image ID from /images/json. 
If you only need confirmation, the response confirms busybox:latest is present and up to date, with digest sha256:d80cd694d3e9...

{"status":"Status: Image is up to date for busybox:latest"}

Parser: Interpretation of the streaming response

- Did the pull start? Yes. The stream shows:
  - Status: Pulling from library/busybox with id "latest"
  - Digest: sha256:d80cd694d3e9467884fcb94b8ca1e20437d8a501096cdf367a5a1918a34fc2fd
  - Status: Image is up to date for busybox:latest
- Progress and completion: The sequence indicates the pull operation began and reported a manifest digest, then the final status states that the image is up to date for busybox:latest. This is consistent with the pull completing (or concluding that the local image for busybox:latest is already current).

Image ID information

- Is an image ID present in the response? No. The streaming payload includes a tag-id "latest" and a digest, but there is no explicit image ID provided.
- Therefore, we cannot report a final image ID from this response.

How to verify and fetch the image ID (if needed)

- If you want to know the exact image ID for busybox:latest, query the daemon for image details, for example:
  - GET http://localhost:2375/images/json and filter for RepoTags including "busybox:latest"
  - Or GET http://localhost:2375/images/busybox:latest/json to retrieve details for that image, which will include the Id and Size fields
- The digest shown (sha256:d80cd694d3e9467884fcb94b8ca1e20437d8a501096cdf367a5a1918a34fc2fd) is the manifest digest, not the image ID. It can help verify integrity but is not the same as the image ID.

Summary of information available

- Final status: Busybox:latest image is present and up to date on the daemon
- Image ID: Not provided in the response
- Repository:tag: busybox:latest
- Size: Not provided in the streaming response

Recommended next steps

- Run GET /images/json (and filter for busybox:latest) or GET /images/busybox:latest/json to obtain the image Id and Size for confirmation.

Parser: Interpretation of the API response

- Did the pull operation start successfully?
  - Yes. The streaming payload begins with "Pulling from library/busybox" and ends with "Status: Image is up to date for busybox:latest," indicating the pull process was initiated and completed successfully (the image is present and up to date).

- Progress and completion summary
  - Pulling from library/busybox (tag: latest) started.
  - Digest provided: sha256:d80cd694d3e9467884fcb94b8ca1e20437d8a501096cdf367a5a1918a34fc2fd (fingerprint of the pulled content).
  - Final status: Image is up to date for busybox:latest (pull completed, no newer layers to download).

- Image identifier (image id)
  - The response does not include an explicit image Id field. However, a digest is provided: sha256:d80cd694d3e9467884fcb94b8ca1e20437d8a501096cdf367a5a1918a34fc2fd. This digest can serve as a content fingerprint for the pulled image.
  - The tag/repository is busybox:latest.

- Repository and tag
  - Repository: busybox
  - Tag: latest

- Size information
  - No size information is present in the response.

- How to verify the image exists locally
  - Call GET /images/json and filter for Repository (or reference) busybox with tag latest.
  - Example approach (conceptual):
    - Request: GET /images/json
    - Filter results for entries where RepoTags includes "busybox:latest"
    - Inspect the image’s Id (or RepoDigests) and Size if provided
  - If you prefer a direct lookup, you can also query an image-specific endpoint like GET /images/busybox:latest/json to retrieve details, including Id and Size (depending on the server’s API support).

Parser: Summary of the API response interpretation

- Did the pull operation start successfully?
  - Yes. The streaming payload shows: "Pulling from library/busybox" and a final status of "Image is up to date for busybox:latest". This indicates a pull operation was initiated and completed successfully, with no new layers downloaded because the local image was already up to date.

- Progress and completion
  - 1) Pulling from library/busybox (tag: latest)
  - 2) Digest: sha256:d80cd694d3e9467884fcb94b8ca1e20437d8a501096cdf367a5a1918a34fc2fd
  - 3) Status: Image is up to date for busybox:latest
  - Interpretation: The image busybox:latest is already present locally and is up to date; no further action was required.

- Image ID
  - Not provided in the streaming response. The payload does not include an explicit image ID.
  - To obtain the image ID, verify the image exists by listing local images:
    - GET /images/json and filter for Repository "busybox" and Tag "latest"
    - You should see an entry including Id (the image ID), RepoTags [ "busybox:latest" ], and size information (VirtualSize/Size).

- Repository:tag
  - busybox:latest

- Size information
  - Not present in the provided response. To get size details, query /images/json and inspect the Size or VirtualSize fields for the busybox:latest image.

- If you need to verify via CLI (alternative to API):
  - docker images busybox:latest
  - This will show the image ID (IMAGE ID column) and its size.
