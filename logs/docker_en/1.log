Thought: Background: No background

Plan: Background: No background
User query: List all current Docker networks. Return their names as a string array.

Plan step 1: Perform a GET request to http://localhost:2375/networks to retrieve the list of current Docker networks. After receiving the response, extract the Name field from each network object and return all network names as a JSON string array in the same order as they appear.

Thought: I will attempt to call the Docker daemon endpoint to fetch the list of networks and then parse the response to collect the network names. Since the user asked for a string array of network names, I will output only the names in an array, preserving the order of the response.

Operation: GET

Input: {
  "url": "http://localhost:2375/networks",
  "params": {},
  "description": "List all Docker networks currently present on the daemon. The API response is expected to be a JSON array where each element is a network object containing a 'Name' field. The goal is to return the names of all networks as a JSON array of strings in the same order as they appear in the response.",
  "output_instructions": "From the API response, extract the 'Name' field from each network object in the array. Produce a JSON array of strings containing these names. If there are no networks, return []. If any item lacks a 'Name' field, skip it. The final answer should be the list of network names as a string array."
}
Response: ["host","web_frontend_net","my_custom_network","none","web-net","bridge","my-network"]
