Notes:
- The response includes a large number of volumes with various naming conventions and some duplicates/aliases (for example, multiple entries with similar names but slight variations or different cases). The list above captures the Name, Driver, and Mountpoint values as they appear in the response.
- Warnings: null (no warnings reported).
Caller: Background: No background
Plan: Background: No background
Thought: I will perform a GET request to the Docker Engine API at localhost:2375 to retrieve the list of all Docker volumes and their basic metadata, focusing on acquiring the volume names.
