query is List the names of all currently running Docker containers. Return them as a string array.
planner received input: List the names of all currently running Docker containers. Return them as a string array.
User query: List the names of all currently running Docker containers. Return them as a string array.

Plan step 1: Call the appropriate Docker API or CLI wrapper to list all containers with status "running", and request only their names.

API response:
Planner: User query: List the names of all currently running Docker containers. Return them as a string array.

Plan step 1: Call the appropriate Docker API or CLI wrapper to list all containers with status "running", and request only their names.

API response:
API Selector: Background: No background
User query: List the names of all currently running Docker containers. Return them as a string array.

Plan step 1: GET http://localhost:2375/containers/json?all=false

API response: 
Instruction: After receiving the API response, post-process to extract the container Names arrays, remove any leading slashes from each name, and return the result as a string array. If there are no running containers, return an empty string array.
Caller: Background: No background
Plan: 
- Execute a GET request to list running Docker containers with all=false.
- Post-process the API response to extract the container Names, remove any leading slashes from each name, and return the result as a string array. If there are no running containers, return an empty string array.
Thought: Preparing to call the Docker host API to retrieve the list of currently running containers, then clean up the Names fields by stripping leading slashes and aggregating into a simple string array. If no containers are running, an empty array should be returned.

Caller: Execution Result: Successfully executed GET http://localhost:2375/containers/json with all=false. Post-processing yielded a single running container name: "jenkins" (the original Names field contained "/jenkins" which was cleaned by removing the leading slash). The resulting string array of currently running container names is ["jenkins"].
planner received input: List the names of all currently running Docker containers. Return them as a string array.
Thought: I have the list of all currently running Docker containers and their names as requested.

Final Answer: ["jenkins"]
