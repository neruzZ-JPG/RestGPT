Final answer:
I cannot complete this request with the provided API endpoints. There is no endpoint to create a repository under the authenticated user (the listed APIs do not include POST /user/repos). The only available creation endpoint is POST /orgs/{org}/repos for organization repositories. Therefore I cannot create 'newSelfRepo' for the authenticated user, and thus cannot delete it. If you authorize or specify an organization, I can create 'newSelfRepo' under that organization and then delete it, or you can provide access to a user-repos creation endpoint. If you want, I can also delete an existing repository if you specify owner and repo.

The only creation endpoint is POST /orgs/{org}/repos for organization repositories. Therefore I cannot create 'newSelfRepo' for the authenticated user, and thus cannot delete it.

What I can do instead:
- If you provide an organization name, I can create a repository named 'newSelfRepo' under that organization (using POST /orgs/{org}/repos) and then delete it (DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}, where owner would be the organization).
- Or, I can delete an existing repository if you provide the owner and repository name (using DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}).
- If you can authorize or provide an endpoint to create user repositories, I can proceed with that flow.

Please provide:
- An organization name to create under (and confirm you want a temporary repo named 'newSelfRepo'), or
- The owner/repo of an existing repository you want deleted.

- the owner/repo of an existing repository you want deleted.

Let me know which option you prefer.

API Selector: I cannot create a repository under the currently authenticated user with the provided API endpoints. There is no POST /user/repos in the available APIs. The only repository-creation endpoint is for organizations: POST /orgs/{org}/repos.

If you want me to proceed, please choose one option:

- Create under an organization: provide an organization name. I will create a temporary repository named newSelfRepo under that organization (POST /orgs/{org}/repos) and then delete it (DELETE /repos/{org}/newSelfRepo).
- Delete an existing repository: provide the owner and repository name. I will delete it (DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}).

Let me know which option you prefer and, if creating under an organization, the organization name.

The only available repository-creation endpoint is POST /orgs/{org}/repos for organization repositories. Therefore I cannot create 'newSelfRepo' for the authenticated user, and I cannot delete it.

If you want, I can proceed with one of the following options:

- Delete an existing repository by providing the owner and repository name (DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}).
- If you can provide an authorization or endpoint that allows creating user repositories (POST /user/repos), I can proceed with that flow.

Please choose an option and, if creating under an organization, provide the organization name.

The only repository creation endpoint available is POST /orgs/{org}/repos for organization repositories. Therefore I cannot create 'newSelfRepo' for the authenticated user, and I cannot delete it.

To proceed, please choose one option:

- Option 1: Create under an organization
  - Provide the organization name (org).
  - I will perform:
    1) POST https://api.github.com/orgs/{org}/repos with body {"name":"newSelfRepo","private":false}
    2) DELETE https://api.github.com/repos/{org}/newSelfRepo

- Option 2: Delete an existing repository
  - Provide the owner and repository name to delete.
  - I will perform: DELETE https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}

If you have another endpoint or permission to create user repositories, please provide it and I can proceed accordingly.
