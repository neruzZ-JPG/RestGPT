Plan: Create a new issue in the GitHub repository chatopsFdse/testRepo with the issue title set to the current date 2025-12-23 and a non-empty placeholder body to satisfy API validation. The plan uses POST to https://api.github.com/repos/chatopsFdse/testRepo/issues with a payload containing title "2025-12-23" and body "Placeholder". The response should return the new issue metadata including at minimum an issue number and html_url, along with confirmation that the title and body match the requested values.

Thought: I will proceed with the final POST request to create the issue, using the non-empty placeholder body to satisfy API validation, and then report back the assigned issue number, URL, and verification that the title and body match the requested values.
