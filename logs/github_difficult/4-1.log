planner received input: Create a new pull request in the repository 'testRepo' owned by GitHub user 'chatopsFdse' to merge the branch 'testBranch' into the 'main' branch, with the title 'test'. Subsequently, modify its content (pull request body) to 'test pull request'. Finally, approve the pull request.
Plan step 2: Query the branches of the repository `chatopsFdse/testRepo` using `GET /repos/chatopsFdse/testRepo/branches` to confirm that both `testBranch` and `main` exist, and extract their branch names and commit SHAs if present.
Planner: Plan step 2: Query the branches of the repository `chatopsFdse/testRepo` using `GET /repos/chatopsFdse/testRepo/branches` to confirm that both `testBranch` and `main` exist, and extract their branch names and commit SHAs if present.
API Selector: Background: No background

Plan: Step 1: Query the GitHub repository chatopsFdse/testRepo using GET /repos/chatopsFdse/testRepo to confirm existence and fetch basic metadata. If it exists, we will later verify branches via GET /repos/chatopsFdse/testRepo/branches to confirm testBranch and main.
User query: Plan step 1: Query the GitHub repository `testRepo` owned by user `chatopsFdse` to confirm that the repository exists and that both branches `testBranch` and `main` exist.
GET https://api.github.com/repos/chatopsFdse/testRepo
Description: Check repository existence and retrieve metadata (id, full_name, owner.login, default_branch). Verification of branches will be done in a subsequent call if the repository exists.
API response: (to be provided by the API caller after executing the request)
Instruction: continue
Caller: Background: No background
Plan: Step 1: Query the GitHub repository chatopsFdse/testRepo using GET /repos/chatopsFdse/testRepo to confirm existence and fetch basic metadata. If it exists, a subsequent verification of branches would be performed via GET /repos/chatopsFdse/testRepo/branches to confirm testBranch and main.
Thought: I will attempt to perform the GET call to verify repository existence for chatopsFdse/testRepo. However, if the execution environment cannot reach the GitHub API, I will report the limitation and cannot proceed to extract metadata or verify branches.
