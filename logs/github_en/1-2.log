Plan: Retrieve public profile information for GitHub user 'shirley' using GET https://api.github.com/users/shirley, and extract the created_at field which indicates the account creation date.

Thought: I will perform a single GET request to fetch the user profile data for 'shirley'. From the response, I will locate the created_at field and present its value in ISO 8601 format. If the field is present, I will clearly state the exact timestamp; if not present or null, I would indicate that the creation date is unavailable. In this case, I expect to obtain a valid timestamp from the API response.
