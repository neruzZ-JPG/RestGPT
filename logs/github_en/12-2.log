Plan: The requested step 2 requires using the GitHub Search API to find repositories owned by the authenticated user. However, the allowed endpoints list does not include any search endpoint (e.g., GET /search/repositories), nor does it include an endpoint to list repositories for a user (e.g., /user/repos or /users/{username}/repos). Therefore, I cannot execute step 2 as specified. I can only proceed if an allowed endpoint is provided that can list a user’s repositories or if a higher-permission/alternative endpoint is made available. I will outline the limitation and request guidance to continue.

No API call needed.

API response: N/A

Instruction: This plan cannot be completed with the current allowed API endpoints. Please either:
- provide access to an allowed endpoint that lists repositories for the authenticated user (e.g., a /user/repos equivalent that exists in the available endpoints), or
- authorize adding or using a different endpoint from the list that can enumerate a user’s repositories (e.g., /repos/{owner}/{repo} variants do not apply for listing), or
- by-passthrough a custom endpoint that returns the authenticated user’s repository names, or
- confirm that I should stop here and await updated endpoints.

Plan: The requested step 2 requires calling a GitHub endpoint that lists repositories for the authenticated user (e.g., /user/repos or /users/{username}/repos) or a search endpoint to filter by the authenticated user.

We need an allowed endpoint that can enumerate a user’s repositories or an alternative method provided by you.

No API call needed.

Plan: 
- Execute GET /user to verify the authenticated identity since the plan to list repositories is not allowed with the available endpoints.
- From the response, extract the login and id of the authenticated user to be used for any subsequent steps (e.g., repository listing if permitted by a future plan).

Thought: Since the endpoint to list repositories for the authenticated user (/user/repos) is not available in the allowed endpoints, the valid next step is to verify the authenticated user identity by calling GET /user and capture the login and id for potential future use.

planner received input: Query the names of all repositories owned by the currently authenticated GitHub account
Plan step 3: Use the authenticated user information obtained from `GET https://api.github.com/user` (specifically the `login` value) to search for repositories owned by this user via the GitHub Search API, by calling `GET https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=user:<login>&per_page=100&page=1`. From the response, extract the `name` field from each repository in the `items` array. If the `total_count` indicates more than 100 results, repeat this call with `page=2,3,...` until all repositories have been retrieved. Collect all repository `name` values into a single list and remove any duplicates. Then return this list of repository names as the final answer.
