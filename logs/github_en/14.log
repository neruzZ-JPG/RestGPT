planner received input: I want to know all issues I have permission to view, including issues in my personal repositories and repositories of organizations I belong to.
User query: I want to know all issues I have permission to view, including issues in my personal repositories and repositories of organizations I belong to.  

Plan step 1: Call the GitHub API endpoint that lists all issues assigned to, created by, or mentioning the authenticated user across all accessible repositories (including personal and organization repositories), without filtering by repository, and request all pages of results.
