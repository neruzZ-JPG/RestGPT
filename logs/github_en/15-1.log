Plan step 2: Inspect the GET `https://api.github.com/orgs/fudanseChatopsOrg/repos` response to obtain the list of repositories for organization fudanseChatopsOrg, including each repository’s `name` and `id`. For each repository returned (for example, `repo_name_1` with `id_1`, `repo_name_2` with `id_2`, etc.), call the GitHub API `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` to list all issues for that specific repository, using `owner = fudanseChatopsOrg` and `repo` equal to the repository name from the previous step. Aggregate all issues from all repositories into a single combined issue list, keeping for each issue at least: `repository_name`, `issue_number`, `title`, `state`, and `html_url`.
