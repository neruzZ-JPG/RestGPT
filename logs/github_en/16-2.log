query is Query all issues in my personal repositories, excluding issues from repositories of organizations I belong to
planner received input: Query all issues in my personal repositories, excluding issues from repositories of organizations I belong to
User query: Query all issues in my personal repositories, excluding issues from repositories of organizations I belong to  
Plan step 1: Call the GitHub API endpoint that lists all issues assigned to or created by the authenticated user (e.g., GET /issues), requesting all issue fields including the repository each issue belongs to.  
API response:

Plan step 1: Call the GitHub API endpoint that lists issues assigned to the authenticated user (GET https://api.github.com/issues), requesting all issue fields including the repository each issue belongs to. Then post-process the results to keep only issues whose repository owner is not an Organization. If the repository owner type is not included in the issue data, perform additional calls to GET /repos/{owner}/{repo} for each unique repository to determine owner.type and filter accordingly.

Thought: I need to perform a GET request to https://api.github.com/issues to fetch issues assigned to the authenticated user, including repository information, and then filter out any issues belonging to repositories owned by Organizations. Since authentication is required to access this endpoint, and no credentials are provided in this interaction, I cannot execute the API call. Without valid authentication, the API will not return data, so I cannot proceed with the filtering logic or post-processing steps. To continue, a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) or an authorization mechanism granting access to the authenticated user's issues is required. Once a token is provided, I will perform the plan exactly as described: fetch issues, filter by repository owner.type != "Organization" (or fetch owner.type via GET /repos/{owner}/{repo} when owner.type is not present in the issue payload), and return the final list of relevant issues with appropriate details.
