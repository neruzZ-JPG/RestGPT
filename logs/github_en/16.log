Instruction: continue

Thought: I will attempt to call GET /user to retrieve the authenticated user's username (login) and user id (id). However, in this environment I may not have an access token to authenticate with GitHub, which could result in an authentication error. If the call succeeds, I will extract the login and id from the response for use in subsequent steps to identify personal repositories. If the call fails due to authentication, I will report the need for a valid access token with the appropriate scope and halt further steps until authentication is provided.

planner received input: Query all issues in my personal repositories, excluding issues from repositories of organizations I belong to
Plan step 2:  
Use the result from `GET https://api.github.com/user` to obtain the authenticated user’s `login` and `id`. Then, call the GitHub Search Issues API to fetch all issues authored by this user, restricting to personal repositories (not org-owned) by using `user:{login} -org:{org1} -org:{org2} ...` in the query once the list of organizations is known. To get that org list, first call `GET /user/orgs` with the authenticated user, collect each organization’s `login`, and construct a single search query that excludes all those orgs.  

Concretely:
1. Call `GET https://api.github.com/user/orgs` to list all organizations the authenticated user belongs to.  
2. From that response, extract each `login` field into a list of organizations: `[org_login_1, org_login_2, ...]`.  
3. Construct a GitHub Issues search query string:  
   - Base filter to get issues involving the user: `involves:{user_login}` (or `author:{user_login}` if only author-created issues are desired).  
   - Add repo type filter so only repositories owned by the user are considered: `user:{user_login}`.  
   - For each organization `org_login_i`, append `-org:{org_login_i}` to exclude issues from repositories owned by those orgs.  
   - The final query string will resemble:  
     `q=involves:{user_login} user:{user_login} -org:org1 -org:org2 ...`  
4. Call `GET https://api.github.com/search/issues` with:  
   - `q` set to the query string from step 3  
   - `per_page` set to a reasonable maximum (e.g., 100)  
   - `page` set to 1  
5. If the `total_count` indicates more results than fit on one page, iterate pages (`page=2,3,...`) until all results are retrieved.  
6. Aggregate all items from all pages into a single list of issues, each including at least: `html_url`, `title`, `state`, `repository_url` (or `repository.full_name` when available), `created_at`, `updated_at`.

3. Construct a GitHub Issues search query string:  
   - Base filter to get issues involving the user: `involves:{user_login}` (or `author:{user_login}` if only author-created issues are desired).  
   - Add repo type filter so only repositories owned by the user are considered: `user:{user_login}`.  
   - For each organization `org_login_i`, append `-org:{org_login_i}` to exclude issues from repositories owned by those orgs.  
   - The final query string will resemble:  
     `q=involves:{user_login} user:{user_login} -org:org1 -org:org2 ...`  
4. Call `GET https://api.github.com/search/issues` with:  
   - `q` set to the query string from step 3  
   - `per_page` set to a reasonable maximum (e.g., 100)  
   - `page` set to 1  
5. If the `total_count` indicates more results than fit on one page, iterate pages (`page=2,3,...`) until all results are retrieved.  
6. Aggregate all items from all pages into a single list of issues, each including at least: `html_url`, `title`, `state`, `repository_url` (or `repository.full_name` when available), `created_at`, `updated_at`.  

API response:
API Selector: Background: No background

Background: No background
User query: Query all issues in my personal repositories, excluding issues from repositories of organizations I belong to
Plan step 1: Call the GitHub API to get the authenticated user’s username and user id using GET /user
GET https://api.github.com/user
API response: 
Instruction: continue
Operation: GET
Input: {
  "url": "https://api.github.com/user",
  "description": "Get the authenticated user",
  "output_instructions": "From the API response, extract the login (username) and id (user id) of the authenticated user. If the response includes additional useful fields such as name, avatar_url, and email, note them as supplementary context. The critical outputs to carry forward are the username (login) and user id (id); these will be used to reference the user's personal repositories in subsequent calls. If the API responds with an authentication error (e.g., 401 or 403), report the need for a valid access token with the appropriate scope (e.g., 'user') to access the endpoint and stop further progress until authentication is provided."

Plan step 1: Call the GitHub API to get the authenticated user’s username and user id using GET /user
GET https://api.github.com/user
API response: 
Instruction: continue
Thought: I will attempt to call GET /user to retrieve the authenticated user's username (login) and user id (id). However, in this environment I may not have an access token to authenticate with GitHub, which could result in an authentication error. If the call succeeds, I will extract the login and id from the response for use in subsequent steps to identify personal repositories. If the call fails due to authentication, I will report the need for a valid access token with the appropriate scope and halt further steps until authentication is provided.
