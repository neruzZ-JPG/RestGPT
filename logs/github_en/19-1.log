planner received input: Query creation date of the branch named 'testBranch' in the repository 'testRepo' owned by GitHub user 'chatopsFdse'
Plan step 2: Since the last API call was `GET https://api.github.com/repos/chatopsFdse/testRepo/branches/testBranch`, inspect that response to locate the `commit.sha` field for branch `testBranch`. Then call `GET https://api.github.com/repos/chatopsFdse/testRepo/commits/{commit_sha}` (substituting the exact SHA from `commit.sha`) to retrieve the commit metadata, and from that response extract `commit.author.date` or `commit.committer.date` (prefer `commit.author.date` if both exist). Use that timestamp as the branch’s creation date (i.e., the date of the tip commit of `testBranch`), and return it as the final answer.
