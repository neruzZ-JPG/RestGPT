Code: 
# Assume data is the API response as a dict
login = data.get('login')
uid = data.get('id')
html_url = data.get('html_url')

if login is not None and uid is not None and html_url is not None:
    parts = [
        "The login is {}".format(login),
        "the id is {}".format(uid),
        "the profile URL is {}".format(html_url)
    ]
    for k in ('name', 'bio', 'public_repos', 'followers', 'following'):
        v = data.get(k)
        if v is not None:
            parts.append("{} is {}".format(k, v))
    print(", ".join(parts))
Parser: The login is Harry, the id is 19156, the profile URL is https://github.com/Harry, public_repos is 0, followers is 19, following is 0

planner received input: Query the profile URL of the GitHub user 'harry'
Plan step 2: Extract the `html_url` field from the GitHub API response for user `harry` and provide that as the profile URL to the user.
