Plan step 1: Call GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number} to fetch the pull request details, including comment counts (to know how many comments exist in total). This uses the available API endpoint: GET https://api.github.com/repos/fudanselab/train-ticket/pulls/250

API response: 
Instruction: continue

Note: The available API set here does not provide a direct endpoint to fetch the actual body of pull request comments (review comments or issue-style comments) as a single combined feed. We can see the counts from the PR metadata, but to retrieve the content of each comment, additional endpoints not listed here would be required. If you’d like, I can proceed to post-process the counts and explain what can be retrieved with the current API set, or request access to a broader API surface to fetch the actual comment bodies.
