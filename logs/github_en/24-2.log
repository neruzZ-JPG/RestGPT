Thought: I will attempt to perform the GET request to https://api.github.com/repos/chatopsFdse/testRepo/contents/README.md to retrieve the README.md file metadata and content. However, I am operating in an environment without network access, so I cannot actually execute the API call. I will still lay out the exact intended request details for clarity and future execution in a network-enabled environment.
