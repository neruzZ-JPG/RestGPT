Thought: I will attempt to call the GitHub API endpoint to fetch the authenticated user's profile at https://api.github.com/user. However, this endpoint requires a valid authentication token (OAuth token or personal access token with the user scope). In the current context, no token is provided, so the request cannot be authenticated and will fail with a 401 Unauthorized. I will present the attempt details and the reason for failure, and await further instruction or a provided token to proceed.
Operation: GET
Input: {

  "description": "The API response is the authenticated GitHub user's profile. The request requires authentication with an OAuth token or personal access token that has the 'user' scope to reveal profile information.",

If the response includes private profile information, only provide publicly available fields unless a valid token with appropriate scope is supplied. If authentication fails, the response will include a 'message' such as 'Requires authentication' and a 'documentation_url'."
