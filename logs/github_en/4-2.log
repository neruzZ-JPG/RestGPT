The provided API set does not include an endpoint to update the authenticated user's profile (there is no PATCH /user in the available endpoints). Therefore I cannot perform this update using the given APIs. If you can use a different API (e.g., the official GitHub REST API PATCH /user) or a GraphQL option, I can proceed.
