Thought: Background: No background provided.

Plan: Step 1: Since updating the authenticated user's profile via PATCH is not included in the provided API list, perform GET https://api.github.com/user to retrieve the current profile values, including the current blog field, so we can propose alternatives (or confirm whether updating via another supported path is possible).

Thought: The requested update (PATCH) cannot be performed with the given API documentation. To proceed responsibly, fetch the current user profile to display existing values (especially the blog field) and determine feasible next steps within the allowed endpoints.

Operation: GET

Input: {
  "url": "https://api.github.com/user",
  "description": "Fetch the currently authenticated user's profile information from GitHub to display existing fields, including the current blog value, because the requested PATCH update endpoint is not included in the provided API list.",
  "output_instructions": "From the API response, extract the current blog value (blog field) of the authenticated user. Also extract key profile fields such as login, id, name, company, location, email, bio, avatar_url to help the user understand the current state. If the blog field is present, include its value exactly as returned. The instruction should explicitly state to return the current value for blog and the other extracted fields. Since the update endpoint PATCH is not included in the provided API list, confirm that updating the blog cannot be performed via the available APIs and propose next steps."
