Caller: Background: No background
Plan: Plan step 1: Call the GitHub API endpoint that returns the list of users the currently authenticated GitHub account is following, i.e., GET /user/following, and retrieve all pages of results if pagination is present.
Thought: I will perform a GET request to https://api.github.com/user/following with no additional parameters to fetch the list of users the authenticated account follows, ensuring that pagination is handled if present.
Operation: GET

planner received input: Query the list of users that the currently authenticated GitHub account is following
Plan step 2: Inspect the HTTP response from `GET https://api.github.com/user/following` to determine whether the request succeeded or failed.  
- If the response status is 200, parse the JSON array of user objects, extract `login` and `id` for each user, and check for a `Link` header indicating pagination; if present, perform additional `GET` requests to the `next` URL(s) until all pages are retrieved, aggregating all users into a single list and counting the total users.  
- If the response status is not 200 (e.g., 401 or 403), read the error body to identify whether authentication is missing or insufficient, and prepare an explanation that authentication (with appropriate scopes) is required to access the following list.
