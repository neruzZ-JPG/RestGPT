Caller: Background: No background
Plan: Background: No background
User query: Plan step 1: Call the GitHub API endpoint to get the list of users that the currently authenticated GitHub account is following (GET /user/following) and return the list of users with their usernames and IDs.
Thought: Thought: Prepare the GET request to https://api.github.com/user/following with a description of the expected response details and explicit extraction instructions for usernames (login) and IDs (id) for each followed user. Do not include any additional steps beyond this API call as per the plan.
Operation: GET
Input: {
  "url": "https://api.github.com/user/following",
  "description": "The API response is a list of users that the authenticated GitHub user is following. Each item contains user details such as login (username) and id. The response is an array of user objects. For each followed user, extract the login and id fields.",
  "output_instructions": "From the API response, which should be a JSON array of user objects, extract the username (login) and the numeric GitHub user id (id) for each followed user. Present the results as a list of objects or pairs showing login and id. If the response is paginated, include only the first page as returned by the API. If authentication is required and the request fails with 401, report that authentication is missing and cannot fetch the list."

Caller: Background: No background
Plan: Background: No background
User query: Plan step 1: Call the GitHub API endpoint to get the list of users that the currently authenticated GitHub account is following (GET /user/following) and return the list of users with their usernames and IDs.
Thought: Thought: Prepare the GET request to https://api.github.com/user/following with a description of the expected response details and explicit extraction instructions for usernames (login) and IDs (id) for each followed user. Do not include any additional steps beyond this API call as per the plan.
Operation: GET
Input: {
  "url": "https://api.github.com/user/following",
  "description": "The API response is a list of users that the authenticated GitHub user is following. Each item contains user details such as login (username) and id. The response is an array of user objects. For each followed user, extract the login and id fields.",
  "output_instructions": "From the API response, which should be a JSON array of user objects, extract the username (login) and the numeric GitHub user id (id) for each followed user. Present the results as a list of objects or pairs showing login and id. If the response is paginated, include only the first page as returned by the API. If authentication is required and the request fails with 401, report that authentication is missing and cannot fetch the list."

Caller: Background: No background
Plan: Background: No background
User query: Plan step 1: Call the GitHub API endpoint to get the list of users that the currently authenticated GitHub account is following (GET /user/following) and return the list of users with their usernames and IDs.
Thought: Thought: Prepare the GET request to https://api.github.com/user/following with a description of the expected response details and explicit extraction instructions for usernames (login) and IDs (id) for each followed user. Do not include any additional steps beyond this API call as per the plan.
Operation: GET
Input: {
  "url": "https://api.github.com/user/following",
  "description": "The API response is a list of users that the authenticated GitHub user is following. Each item contains user details such as login (username) and id. The response is an array of user objects. For each followed user, extract the login and id fields.",
  "output_instructions": "From the API response, which should be a JSON array of user objects, extract the username (login) and the numeric GitHub user id (id) for each followed user. Present the results as a list of objects or pairs showing login and id. If the response is paginated, include only the first page as returned by the API. If authentication is required and the request fails with 401, report that authentication is missing and cannot fetch the list."
