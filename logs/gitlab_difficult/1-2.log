- Working with issues (GET /projects/{id}/issues, POST /projects/{id}/issues, etc.)
- Managing repository data (GET /projects/{id}/repository/tree, GET /projects/{id}/repository/branches, POST /projects/{id}/repository/branches, etc.)
- Searching within projects or groups (GET /projects/{id}/search, GET /search)

If you’d like, tell me another goal you want to achieve with the existing APIs, and I’ll plan the steps accordingly. Alternatively, you can request that the API provider add group invitation endpoints.
