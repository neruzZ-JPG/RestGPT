Final answer:
I cannot create an invitation because the invitations endpoint is not available in the provided API set. You’ll need to invite the user via the GitLab UI or obtain an admin to enable an invitations API. If you want, I can help you plan alternative steps using the available endpoints (e.g., create an issue to request an invitation, or fetch project details to prepare for a manual invitation).

Plan alternative (optional, using available APIs):
- Option A: Create an issue to request the invitation
  - POST https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/68772011/issues
  - Body: 
    - title: "Request invitation for user fdseChatopsTest@gmail.com"
    - description: "Please invite this user with Maintainer access to project 68772011. Desired expiration: 2027-11-19."
- Option B: Retrieve project details to verify project exists before manual invitation
  - GET https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/68772011

If you approve, I can prepare the exact request body for Option A or proceed with Option B.
