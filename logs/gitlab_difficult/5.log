- Step 3: Delete the file test.txt from the repository on branch main with commit message 'delete' using a DELETE request to the GitLab API.

Thought: I will perform the three required API calls in sequence, capturing the essential outputs (file path, branch, and commit IDs) from each response to report back to the user. For the creation step, I will use the POST method, including branch, content, and commit_message in the request body. For the update step, I will use the PUT method with the new content and a new commit_message. For the deletion step, I will use the DELETE method including the branch and commit_message. After each operation, I will extract and report the resulting file_path and commit_id (as applicable) to confirm the operation succeeded and to feed any needed data into subsequent steps.

Thought: Thought: Background: Background: No background

Plan: 
- Step 1: Create a new file at path test.txt in project 68772011 on branch main with content 'test' and commit message 'test' using a POST request to the GitLab API.
- Step 2: Update the same file test.txt on branch main to have content 'updated content' with commit message 'update' using a PUT request to the GitLab API.
- Step 3: Delete the file test.txt from the repository on branch main with commit message 'delete' using a DELETE request to the GitLab API.

Thought: I will perform the three required API calls in sequence, capturing the essential outputs (file_path, branch, and commit IDs) from each response to report back to the user. For the creation step, I will use the POST method, including branch, content, and commit_message in the request body. For the update step, I will use the PUT method with the new content and a new commit_message. For the deletion step, I will use the DELETE method including the branch and commit_message. After each operation, I will extract and report the resulting file_path and commit_id (as applicable) to confirm the operation succeeded and to feed any needed data into subsequent steps.
