planner received input: Query the ID of the GitLab user 'fdsechatops'.
API response: The GitLab search API `GET https://gitlab.com/api/v4/search?scope=users&search=fdsechatops` was called. The response is an empty list `[]`, meaning no users were found matching the search term `fdsechatops`.

Thought: The search endpoint did not return any user objects, so there is no user whose username exactly equals `fdsechatops`. There is no additional GitLab user lookup needed; the query is fulfilled with the information that such a user does not exist (or is not publicly findable) on gitlab.com.

Final Answer: There is currently no publicly searchable GitLab user with the username `fdsechatops`, so no user ID can be returned for that username.
