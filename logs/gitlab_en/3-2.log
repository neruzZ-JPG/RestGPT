Caller: Background: Background: No background

User query: Plan step 1: Call the GitLab group search API for group 97683359, specifying `scope=projects` and `search=test`, to retrieve all projects within group 97683359 whose name/path/description match the term "test", and return the full project objects (including IDs, names, paths, web URLs, descriptions, visibility, and any other fields the API provides).
Thought: I will perform the GET request using the provided endpoint with the given query parameters.
Operation: GET
Input: {
  "url": "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/97683359/search",
  "params": {
    "scope": "projects",
    "search": "test"
  },
  "description": "Search within the group owned by the authenticated user for projects whose name/path/description include 'test', returning full project objects including IDs, names, paths, web URLs, descriptions, visibility, and any other fields the API provides.",
  "output_instructions": "From the API response, extract the list of project objects. For each project, collect its id, name, path, web_url, description, visibility. If multiple projects are returned, include all; if the API response is paginated, gather all pages to assemble the full list. Present a structured summary listing each project's id, name, path, web_url, description, and visibility. If there are no matching projects, indicate that no results were found."
}
Plan: Background: No background
Plan: Re-execute the GitLab group search for group 97683359 with scope=projects and search=test, requesting the raw JSON to fetch all matching projects. Use per_page large enough (e.g., 100) and handle pagination if provided by headers.
User query: Plan step 2: Re-execute the GitLab group search for group 97683359 with `scope=projects` and `search=test`, ensuring that the raw JSON response body is returned. From that response, extract every matching project’s `id`, `name`, `path`, `web_url`, `description`, and `visibility`. If GitLab returns multiple pages, fetch all pages using the pagination headers (`X-Next-Page`, `page`/`per_page`), then merge all results into a single list.

Execution Result: 
I cannot complete the API calls in this environment because there is no direct network access to external services like GitLab. As a result, I cannot fetch the list of projects within group 97683359 that match the search term "test" or handle pagination to assemble a full list of results. 

What I can do, however, is lay out precisely what would happen and how I would present the results if I were able to perform the calls, and I can process any data you provide me:

- If you provide the raw JSON response from GET https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/97683359/search?scope=projects&search=test (and, if applicable, subsequent pages indicated by the X-Next-Page header or page/per_page values), I will:
  - Collect every project object returned across all pages.
  - For each project, extract the fields: id, name, path, web_url, description, visibility.
  - If there are multiple pages, continue fetching until there is no next page, merging all pages into a single list.
  - Present a structured summary listing each project's id, name, path, web_url, description, and visibility.
  - If no projects match, clearly indicate that no results were found.

- Alternatively, if you can enable networked execution in this environment or provide an accessible API response, I will immediately parse and deliver the required structured output.

- If you want me to proceed with a simulated example, I can fabricate a small sample with a couple of project objects to demonstrate the exact output format and extraction logic, but it will not reflect real GitLab data.
