GET https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/97683359/invitations
Thought: I will call the GitLab API to fetch pending group invitations for group 97683359, using the invitations endpoint. If the response includes multiple invitations, I will plan to extract each invitation's id, email, invite_status, invited_at, and group_id, and also note pagination details if present. If there are no invitations, I will indicate that the list is empty.

Plan step 1: Use the GitLab API to list all pending group invitations for the GitLab group with ID 97683359 (e.g., GET /groups/97683359/invitations or the equivalent endpoint for group pending members).

Thought: I will call the GitLab API to fetch pending group invitations for group 97683359, using the invitations endpoint. If the response includes multiple invitations, I will plan to extract each invitation's id, email, invite_status, invited_at, and group_id, and also note pagination details if present. If there are no invitations, I will indicate that the list is empty.

Operation: GET
Input: {
    "url": "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/97683359/invitations",
    "params": {
        "page": "1",
        "per_page": "100"
    },
    "description": "The API response is the list of pending group invitations for the GitLab group with id 97683359, viewable by the authenticated user. The response may be paginated and may include details such as invitation id, email, and invite status.",
    "output_instructions": "From the API response, extract the following for each invitation: the invitation id (id), the email of the invited user (email), the status of the invitation (invite_status), the timestamp when the invitation was created or invited_at (invited_at), and the group id the invitation belongs to (group_id). If multiple invitations exist, list all invitations with their corresponding fields. If the response includes pagination metadata (page, per_page, total, total_pages), capture and report them as well. If there are no invitations, clearly state that the invitation list is empty."
}
Response: 
Thought: The system should return the API response for the invitations. I will parse the list of invitations and identify their IDs, emails, statuses, invited_at timestamps, and the group ID, along with any pagination data if provided. 
Execution Result: 

Response: [{'id': None, 'email': 'fdsechatopstest@gmail.com', 'invite_status': 'pending', 'invited_at': '2025-12-18T13:14:45.886Z', 'group_id': 97683359}]


Execution Result: Successfully called GET https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/97683359/invitations?page=1&per_page=100. The API response includes one pending invitation for the group. The extracted invitation details are:
- invitation id: None
- email: fdsechatopstest@gmail.com
- invite_status: pending
- invited_at: 2025-12-18T13:14:45.886Z
- group_id: 97683359

There were no additional invitations in the response, and no explicit pagination metadata (page, per_page, total, total_pages) was provided in the response. The plan’s inputs for a potential future API call would use the extracted values above.
